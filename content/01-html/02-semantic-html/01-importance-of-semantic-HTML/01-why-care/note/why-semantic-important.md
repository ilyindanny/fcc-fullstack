title: Semantic HTML

#### Semantic HTML

- **Semantics** means meaning, not just appearance.  
- Each HTML element has a purpose beyond style.
- **Core idea:**  

> Semantic HTML is thinking one level up â€” not *how it looks* but *what it means*.  
> The best code is understandable without CSS or JavaScript.

Example: {.marker}  
`<p>` means paragraph, a logical block of text.

##### Why it matters:
  1. **Accessibility:** Screen readers rely on semantic tags to understand content.  
  2. **SEO:** Search engines rank semantic content higher.  
  3. **Maintainability:** Code is easier to read and edit when structure is clear.

Avoid non-semantic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` when possible; prefer semantic tags like `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<strong>`, etc.
