#### Strong vs B Element

##### Purpose

- `<strong>` — semantic HTML element. Indicates **importance** of the text. `<strong>` is meant for content that should be emphasized with **semantic weight** — e.g. warnings, critical info, key points.
Screen readers often **stress** such text when reading aloud.

```html
<!-- Semantic importance -->
<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> This product may cause allergic reactions.
</p>
```


- `<b>` — purely **stylistic** element. Highlights text **visually** without adding meaning. `<b>` is used to simply draw the reader’s attention — for instance, product names, keywords, or other non-critical highlights. It’s **not semantic**, only visual.

```html
<!-- Visual emphasis only -->
<p>
  We tested several products, including the <b>SuperSound 3000</b> for audio
  quality, the <b>QuickCharge Pro</b> for fast charging, and the
  <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> for cleaning. The first two performed well, but the
  <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> did not meet expectations.
</p>
```


Both will appear bold in most browsers, but only `<strong>` carries **semantic meaning**.
