## Screen Magnifiers

### Purpose

Screen magnifiers assist people with low vision in accessing digital content by enlarging text, graphics, and interface elements.

### How They Work

- Enlarge screen content (often 200%+).
- Navigate with mouse or keyboard.
- Customizable zoom levels and features.

### Use Cases

- Reading small text in emails, articles, apps.
- Clicking small buttons, links, and form elements.
- Improving visibility and reducing eye strain.

### Developer Considerations

- Use scalable fonts.
- Apply responsive design.
- Provide high contrast and customizable colors.
- Avoid sticky or oversized navbars.
- Use real text (not images of text).
- Place feedback near triggering elements.
