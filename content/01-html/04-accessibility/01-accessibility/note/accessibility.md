#### What Is Accessibility?

- **Accessibility** means designing websites and products usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

- Disabilities impacting web use include: blindness, low vision, color blindness, deafness, motor difficulties, attention/memory issues, speech difficulties, and sensitivity to flashing lights.

- The **W3C** developed standards called **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to help create accessible websites.

- WCAG is based on four core principles (**POUR**):
  - **P: Perceivable**  
    Content must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., alt text for images).
  
  - **O: Operable**  
    User interface must be usable via different input methods (keyboard, mouse, etc.).
  
  - **U: Understandable**  
    Information and UI must be clear and simple (avoid complex language).
  
  - **R: Robust**  
    Content must work across various browsers and assistive technologies.

- Using **semantic HTML** improves compatibility with browsers and assistive devices.

- Accessibility is essential for inclusive, high-quality web development that respects all users.

- Check your siteâ€™s accessibility using WCAG Quick Reference and testing tools.



*Remember: Accessibility is not an add-on but a core part of good web design.*
