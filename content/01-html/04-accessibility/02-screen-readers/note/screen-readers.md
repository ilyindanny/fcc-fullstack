#### Screen Readers

**Screen readers** are assistive tools primarily for blind and visually impaired users, but also help people with dyslexia and cognitive disabilities.

##### Challenge:  

- Many apps/websites are not screen-reader friendly.
- Developers must learn to build accessible software for all users.
