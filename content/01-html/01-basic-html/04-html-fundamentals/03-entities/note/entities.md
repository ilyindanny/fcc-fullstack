## HTML Entities

HTML entities are used to represent reserved characters in HTML, such as `<`, `>`, `"`, and `&`.

To display the following HTML code on a webpage as plain text:

    `<div class="example">Hello & welcome!</div>`

you need to write it in the HTML source like this:

    `&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Hello &amp; welcome!&lt;/div&gt;`

### Types of HTML Entities

*   **Named characters:** `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&amp;` and many others
*   **Decimal numeric reference:** `&#60;` — uses the Unicode decimal number of the character
*   **Hexadecimal numeric reference:** `&#x3C;` — same as above but in hexadecimal format
