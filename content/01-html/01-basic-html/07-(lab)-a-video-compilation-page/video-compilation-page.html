                What Makes a Website Beautiful: The Anatomy of Modern Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                Web design is not just about making things look pretty — it’s
                about visual communication. A well-designed website guides the
                user’s eye, creates emotional resonance, and makes interaction
                feel natural and effortless.

                In this lab, we’ll explore what actually makes a website
                “beautiful.” Spoiler: it’s not flashy animations or fancy
                graphics. It’s the foundations — typography, spacing, color,
                composition, and responsiveness. Let’s break down three
                essential principles of modern web design, with short videos for
                each.

                <h2>1. Visual Hierarchy and Typography</h2>
                <p>
                    Typography is more than just choosing a font. It’s about
                    creating structure and rhythm with text — what should the
                    user see first? What should feel subtle? Good typography
                    builds trust and clarity, and makes your content easier to
                    digest.

            <section>
                <h2>2. Layout and Spacing with CSS Grid</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern layout tools like CSS Grid allow designers to create
                    precise, responsive, and visually balanced pages. In this
                    section, you’ll see how grid systems bring order to your
                    content, and how spacing creates breathing room for better
                    readability.

            <section>
                <h2>3. Small Details: Buttons, Shadows, and Effects</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it’s the small things that make a site feel
                    “designed.” Smooth hover effects, well-shaped buttons, soft
                    shadows — all these touches signal quality. This final
                    section shows how subtle effects can make your UI feel
                    polished and intentional.
