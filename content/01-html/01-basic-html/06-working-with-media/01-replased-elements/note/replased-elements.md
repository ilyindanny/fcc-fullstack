## What Are Replaced Elements

A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself.


**The image element, which embeds an `image` on your web page:**

`<img src="example-img-url" alt="Descriptive text goes here">`

(The element itself is replaced with the external object: the `image`).


**A more robust example might be the `iframe` element, which embeds an external site on your web page:**

`<iframe src="https://www.example.com" title="Example Site"></iframe>`

**An `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `image`:**

`<input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">`
