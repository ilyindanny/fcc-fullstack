#### Image Licenses

Images are intellectual property and protected by copyright. By default — **all rights reserved**.

You can legally use an image if:

- You have **written permission** from the author.
- You **purchased a license** (e.g. from stock sites).
- Your use qualifies as **fair use** (limited, transformative, not harming the owner).

##### Fair Use
- Allows use without permission if your usage is **transformative** (e.g. commentary, parody).
- Risky: not always legally safe.

##### License Types

**Creative Commons (CC)**
- `CC BY` – free use with **attribution**.
- `CC BY-SA` – must use the **same license**.
- `CC BY-ND` – **no modifications** allowed.
- `CC BY-NC` – **non-commercial use** only.
- `CC0` – **public domain**, no restrictions.

**Other**
- **BSD** – permissive, used mostly for code.
- **Public Domain** – no copyright, full freedom to use.
