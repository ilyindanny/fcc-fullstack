#### What is UTF-8

UTF-8, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web.

**Example:**

HTML source code:

    `<p>café</p>`

Rendered output:

**café**

**Required Meta element for UTF-8**

    `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

By setting the character encoding to UTF-8, it ensures that the accented "e" character (`é`) is displayed correctly on the page.
