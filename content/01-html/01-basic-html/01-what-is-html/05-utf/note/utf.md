#### What is UTF-8

UTF-8, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web.

Example: {.marker}  

HTML source code:

- `<p>café</p>` {.language-html}

Rendered output:

- **café**

Required Meta element for UTF-8: {.marker}  

`<meta charset="UTF-8">` {.language-html}

By setting the character encoding to UTF-8, it ensures that the accented "e" character (`é`) is displayed correctly on the page.
