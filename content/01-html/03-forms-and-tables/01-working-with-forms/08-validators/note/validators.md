#### Validators

- **HTML is forgiving**: Browsers auto-correct common mistakes (e.g. missing closing tags), but this can lead to unexpected rendering.

- **Validators catch structural errors**: They check your HTML against the official specifications to ensure correctness and predictability.

Common mistake example: {.marker}  

  ```html
  <h2>Missing closing tag
  <p>This paragraph might be treated as part of the heading!</p>
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Cleaner, more reliable HTML
  - Better accessibility and cross-browser consistency
  - Easier code reviews and maintenance

- **Popular tools**:
  - [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
  - [HTML Validator at jsonformatter.org](https://jsonformatter.org/html-validator)

- **Pro tip**: Even if the browser "accepts" your code, a validator helps you understand what’s *correct* vs what’s just *tolerated*.
