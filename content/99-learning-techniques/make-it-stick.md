# Learning Methods from *Make It Stick*

The book *Make It Stick* by Peter Brown, Henry Roediger, and Mark McDaniel is a science-based exploration of how learning really works. It exposes the myths of passive learning and presents a set of counterintuitive yet highly effective techniques that improve long-term retention and understanding.

## Retrieval Practice

**Core Idea**: Don’t just reread — recall. Strengthen memory by actively retrieving information from your mind, not by reviewing it passively.

**Examples**:
- Close the book and try to recall what you just read in your own words.
- Use flashcards with self-generated questions.
- Quiz yourself after each topic.

**Why It Works**:  
Memory strengthens through use. The more often you retrieve information, the more accessible and durable it becomes.

---

## Spaced Repetition

**Core Idea**: Review material over increasing intervals, not all at once.

**Examples**:
- Use apps like Anki or create your own spaced schedule.
- Revisit notes after a day, then three days later, then a week, etc.

**Why It Works**:  
Forgetting is natural. Recalling material just as you're about to forget it forces the brain to work harder and strengthens memory traces.

## Interleaved Practice

**Core Idea**: Mix different types of problems or topics instead of practicing one type repeatedly.

**Examples**:
- When studying programming, mix loops, conditionals, and array operations.
- When learning math, alternate between different problem types.

**Why It Works**:  
Interleaving forces you to distinguish between types of tasks and apply the right approach, improving recognition and flexible problem-solving.

## Generation

**Core Idea**: Try to come up with an answer or solution before being shown the correct one.

**Examples**:
- Attempt to define a concept before reading the definition.
- Solve a problem before watching a tutorial.
- Guess a word in a foreign language based on context.

**Why It Works**:  
Trying and failing creates a "need to know" state. When you later see the answer, it sticks more deeply because your brain has already activated relevant pathways.

---

## Elaboration

**Core Idea**: Add meaning to new information by connecting it to what you already know.

**Examples**:
- Explain a new idea by linking it to familiar concepts.
- Use metaphors or analogies.
- Teach the concept to someone else.

**Why It Works**:  
Your brain remembers meaning better than isolated facts. The more associations you create, the stronger and more retrievable the memory.

---

## Reflection

**Core Idea**: Think back on what you’ve learned to consolidate it and gain insight.

**Examples**:
- Journal after each learning session.
- Ask yourself: What was new? What was hard? What would I do differently next time?

**Why It Works**:  
Reviewing and analyzing your own learning helps make connections, correct misconceptions, and reinforce memory.

---

## Calibration

**Core Idea**: Check whether your confidence matches your actual understanding.

**Examples**:
- Use low-stakes testing to verify knowledge.
- Try teaching or explaining a concept without notes.
- Reflect on whether you really understand or just feel like you do.

**Why It Works**:  
People often overestimate what they know. Calibration helps avoid illusions of competence and guides focus toward real gaps.

## Desirable Difficulties

**Core Idea**: Learning that feels effortful often leads to better retention.

**Note**: This is not a method but a principle. Many techniques above fall under this idea, including:
- Spaced repetition
- Retrieval practice
- Interleaved practice
- Generation

**Examples**:
- Use quizzes instead of rereading.
- Allow some forgetting before reviewing.
- Try explaining a topic before fully understanding it.

**Why It Works**:  
When learning is too easy, we form shallow, fragile memories. Struggling — within reason — activates deeper processing and long-term encoding.

## Final Thoughts

Real learning doesn't feel easy. If you're struggling to recall, to explain, or to connect concepts — you're probably doing it right. The mind resists effort, but effort is what transforms exposure into mastery.

When learning feels hard, that’s often a signal that it’s working.
