## About the Project

Originally based on dynamic routing and HTML templates, this project was later refactored into a static site generator after discussing the workflow with ChatGPT. The new version uses Markdown as the source format and pre-builds the content before deployment. This approach makes the project easier to maintain and better suited for learning.  
All architecture decisions were made collaboratively and gradually â€” starting from simple ideas and adapting them step by step.
